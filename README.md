# 🎯 NEET-PG Immersion Kit (Microbiology + OBGYN Focus)

This repository is a **high-intensity, pattern-driven revision kit** for NEET-PG aspirants, especially designed for a focused and deep attempt on **Microbiology** and **Obstetrics & Gynecology**.

Built with a custom learning architecture—combining **pattern recognition**, **story-based conceptualization**, **semantic dissection**, and **multi-level MCQ integration**—this kit aims to provide maximum conceptual penetration in the shortest possible time.

> This project was initiated to support a personal NEET-PG attempt and is shared here to help others attempting similar focused preparation.

## 🚀 How to Use This Kit

1. **Start with `01-pattern-recognition/`**  
   Understand how NEET designs questions in Micro and OBGYN.

2. **Explore story-based conceptual entries** in `02-story-based-learning/`  
   These will help anchor knowledge deeper than rote memorization.

3. **Scan through the `03-probable-topic-grids/`**  
   Identify what you’ve covered vs. what’s left.

4. **Test your prep in `04-integrated-mcqs/` (Levels 1–3)**  
   Attempt each level progressively, tracking confidence levels.

5. **Verify your answers in `05-answer-explanations/`**  
   Each explanation includes concept tags and links to topics.

6. **Use the tools in `06-metacognitive-tools/`**  
   Apply question classification and self-awareness tools to analyze your attempts.

## 🧠 Final Notes

This kit is designed to **amplify focus**, not cover all 19 subjects at once. If you're attempting NEET-PG with limited time and want to master just 1–2 subjects with intensity, this method is for you.
