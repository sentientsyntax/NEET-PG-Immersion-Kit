# 🎯 NEET-PG Immersion Kit (Microbiology + OBGYN Focus)

This repository is a **high-intensity, pattern-driven revision kit** for NEET-PG aspirants, designed for a focused and deep attempt on **Microbiology** and **Obstetrics & Gynecology**.

Built with a custom learning architecture—combining **pattern recognition**, **story-based conceptualization**, **topic prediction**, and **multi-level MCQ integration**—this kit provides maximum conceptual clarity in the shortest possible time.

> Originally created for a personal NEET-PG 2025 preparation sprint. Now open-sourced to help other focused learners.

## 🧠 Final Notes

This kit is **not a full-subject syllabus**. It's for **deep-diving into 1–2 subjects** (Micro & OBGYN) when time is limited and focus is essential.

Use it as part of a 3–7 day immersion sprint, or as a **targeted revision capsule** alongside your broader prep.

If you find this kit useful, feel free to contribute, open an issue, or suggest improvements.
