# 🚀 Overview: OBGYN 


## **How NEET Asks OBGYN**

OBGYN in NEET-PG is not just about facts. It’s a **high-stakes logic game**: *Which week? What complication? Which drug? What next step?

> 🎯 Your job? **Track timing + think clinically + eliminate traps.**

### 📌 Table: NEET Framing Styles in OBGYN MCQs

| Element                         | What This Tells You To Focus On                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trimester-based logic**       | NEET uses the *week of pregnancy* to shift the answer entirely.  |
| **Obstetric emergencies**       | You’ll be tested on *what to do first*, even if you know the Dx. |
| **Contraception scenarios**     | Real-world logic: *age, parity, comorbidities* guide the choice. |
| **Ultrasound + Drugs by Weeks** | Timeline mastery: *what is done when*, and *what is safe when*.  |
| **Gynaec Pathology**            | You need to spot key features: *fibroid vs carcinoma vs AUB*.    |
| **Surgical understanding**      | Know *which step*, *which cut*, and *what’s contraindicated*.    |

> 👀 This is pattern recognition, not just recall. Every MCQ is a “clinical puzzle with layers.”

### 🧠 NEET’s Most Loved OBGYN Zones (Your Anchor Points)

These are the **zones NEET won’t skip** — the ones that appear year after year, in a rotated style.

| Cluster              | Why NEET Loves It                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pregnancy**        | It mixes physiology, ANC schedules, and risk factor logic.        |
| **Labor & Delivery** | Tests monitoring + intervention steps → real-life priority logic  |
| **Postpartum**       | NEET loves *Lochia, PPH, and Sheehan* because they confuse easily |
| **Gynae disorders**  | High yield + high confusion → PCOS, AUB, Endometriosis            |
| **Oncology**         | HPV + CA cervix staging = favorite examiner playground            |
| **Contraception**    | MCQs are scenario-based: age, parity, safety, reversibility       |

## 🧪 Sample NEET-PG Pattern MCQs (with reasoning)

### Example 1: Trimester Physiology

> **Q:** At which trimester does the cardiac output reach its peak in pregnancy?

* A. First
* B. Second
* C. Third
* D. Postpartum

✅ **Answer:** B — Second trimester

🧠 *Why?* NEET asks physiology timing — not fact recall. Second trimester = peak CO due to reduced vascular resistance + max plasma volume.

---

### Example 2: Obstetric Emergency

> **Q:** A woman in labor has sudden painless vaginal bleeding with a firm uterus. What’s the likely diagnosis?

* A. Placenta previa
* B. Abruptio placentae
* C. Uterine rupture
* D. Vasa previa

✅ **Answer:** A — Placenta previa

🧠 *Why?* NEET embeds **key clues** — *painless + firm uterus*. This rules out abruptio (painful), rupture (loss of station), and vasa previa (fetal bleeding).

---

### Example 3: Drug Safety in Pregnancy

> **Q:** Which of the following antibiotics is safest in pregnancy for UTI?

* A. Ciprofloxacin
* B. Nitrofurantoin
* C. Tetracycline
* D. Chloramphenicol

✅ **Answer:** B — Nitrofurantoin

🧠 *Why?* NEET checks drug class safety **per trimester**. Fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines are teratogenic; Nitrofurantoin is category B — safest.

## 🧠 Observation Skill-Building While Solving MCQs

> As you solve any NEET MCQ, ask yourself:

| Self-Check Prompt                                         | Why This Builds Exam Strength                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “What **layer** is being tested — fact, logic, clinical?” | Detects *how deep* the question is intended to go            |
| “What’s the **irrelevant detail**?”                       | Filters out clinical fluff — NEET always includes it         |
| “Is this a **first step** or **best step** question?”     | Timing-based decision-making is NEET’s favorite trap         |
| “Where is the **cross-link**? Is this Path + Gynae?”      | Activates interdisciplinary memory pathways                  |
| “What’s the **examiner’s intention** here?”               | Builds meta-awareness → you stop getting emotionally trapped |

## 💡 NEET Examiner Psychology (OBGYN Section)

| Theme                         | What Examiner Really Wants to Test                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trimester-based logic**     | “Can you sequence normal vs pathological changes by week?” |
| **Emergency decision-making** | “Do you know the priority protocol — not just diagnosis?”  |
| **Drug use in pregnancy**     | “Do you understand safety and timing, or just names?”      |
| **Gynae path spotting**       | “Can you differentiate similar symptoms (AUB vs Fibroid)?” |
| **Screening & staging**       | “Can you apply guidelines, not just name them?”            |
| **Contraception selection**   | “Can you match the right method to patient profile?”       |

## 🧭 Cross-Subject Links in OBGYN (Train These Reflexes)

| OBGYN → Subject  | NEET Style Question                                            |

| **PSM**          | Antenatal coverage, maternal mortality causes                  |
| **Pathology**    | Histology of endometrium, tumor markers, cervical biopsy logic |
| **Medicine**     | Eclampsia, Diabetes in pregnancy, SLE                          |
| **Anatomy**      | Uterine ligaments, pelvic floor, blood supply of uterus        |

## 🔓 Unlocking the OBGYN Mindset

> 🧠 OBGYN is about **sequencing, safety, and steps**.

Ask yourself while revising:

* “What happens at this **week**?”
* “What is the **safe choice** in this condition?”
* “What is the **protocol**, not just the diagnosis?”
